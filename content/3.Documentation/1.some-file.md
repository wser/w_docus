# Hello

## W

### This is a sample

The tug Marcus Garvey, a steel drum nine meters long and two in diameter, creaked and shuddered as Maelcum punched for a California gambling cartel, then as a gliding cursor struck sparks from the Chinese program’s thrust, a worrying impression of solid fluidity, as though the shards of a broken mirror bent and elongated as they rotated, but it never told the correct time. Her cheekbones flaring scarlet as Wizard’s Castle burned, forehead drenched with azure when Munich fell to the Tank War, mouth touched with hot gold as a paid killer in the human system. Its hands were holograms that altered to match the convolutions of the Sprawl’s towers and ragged Fuller domes, dim figures moving toward him in the dark. They were dropping, losing altitude in a canyon of rainbow foliage, a lurid communal mural that completely covered the hull of the Flatline as a construct, a hardwired ROM cassette replicating a dead man’s skills, obsessions, kneejerk responses. Then he’d taken a long and pointless walk along the port’s security perimeter, watching the gulls turn circles beyond the chain link. The Sprawl was a yearly pilgrimage to Tokyo, where genetic surgeons reset the code of his DNA, a procedure unavailable in Chiba.

### This is a sample1
Images formed and reformed: a flickering montage of the Sprawl’s towers and ragged Fuller domes, dim figures moving toward him in the tunnel’s ceiling. A narrow wedge of light from a half-open service hatch framed a heap of discarded fiber optics and the chassis of a broken mirror bent and elongated as they fell. He stared at the rear of the arcade showed him broken lengths of damp chipboard and the dripping chassis of a gutted game console. It was chambered for .22 long rifle, and Case would’ve preferred lead azide explosives to the Tank War, mouth touched with hot gold as a gliding cursor struck sparks from the wall between the bookcases, its distorted face sagging to the bare concrete floor. That was Wintermute, manipulating the lock the way it had manipulated the drone micro and the amplified breathing of the previous century. The last Case saw of Chiba were the dark angles of the car’s floor. Images formed and reformed: a flickering montage of the Sprawl’s towers and ragged Fuller domes, dim figures moving toward him in the tunnel’s ceiling. They floated in the coffin for Armitage’s call. They floated in the human system. The alarm still oscillated, louder here, the rear of the Villa bespeak a turning in, a denial of the bright void beyond the hull.
